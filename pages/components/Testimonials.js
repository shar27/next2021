"I hired Shariq A. to help with my Shopify store's SEO, loading speed/performance and rebranding. 
He was efficient and had a quick turnaround. He took the time to understand what I wanted to achieve, was very responsive and kept me in the loop all the time. 
Given that English is both of our native languages, it was also easier for us to communicate. 
I had previously worked with another developer where English wasn't their first language and it was harder for me to explain what I wanted. Shariq also helped me to understand each part of what he was doing 
by providing me with relevant resources. Overall, Shariq is an excellent communicator and has a great work ethic. Will definitely use him again for future projects. Highly recommend!"

      "Shariq was really helpful and efficient, I reached out to him because I had been running a successful business
      offline and I wanted to make the switch to online. I am not the most technical person however he explained each
      step really well and kept me in the loop at all times."
